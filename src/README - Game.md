#2D Game Development - MidTerm Game

You're a Mole, looking for treasure in the underground levels

Traverse the overworld, finding cave openings. Use the arrow keys to move

Approach the cave openings, and shift to a 2D platformer, working around the single screen
challenges. The controls change as well.
L/R arrow keys still move
Up is now reserved for the jump feature
While in the air, you can now increase your speed with an all purpose dash by pressing (and holding) the spacebar
While on the ground or a platform, press E to dig underneath the platform
If you're inside a platform, by pressing jump you can perform the Ground Burst, a high speed vertical movement tech

Various enemies and obstacles roam the underground, so watch out!
